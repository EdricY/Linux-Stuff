myshell.sh is an adaptation of a class assignment. It gives the user's shell and keeps a history of its usage. The idea of writing to the program itself came from my inability to print only some output to the console.

Quines print their source code without reading from the file. A bunch of iterations of that are here. Some work and some are really close.  I tackled this problem in python and bash. 
I later decided to do it in an html page [here](https://github.com/EdricY/COS143-Webpage-Design/blob/master/quine.html). 

Test scripts print pretty patterns to the console. Sadly, it assumes a very specific screen size.
